# Running the app
Open with Visual Studio 2022.
Requirements: .NET Core 7 (At least the Desktop Runtime)

# Assumptions
Comments are present throuout the code. They are easy to follow.

# Enhancements
If more time would be available, I'd spend a little in UI polishing (a more complex theme, some colors / images in certain areas -> ex: refresh button) and writing some more tests.
